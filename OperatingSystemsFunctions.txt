One of the macOS functions is Dark mode. 
Dark mode turns everything that is usally white, a darker color like grey or black. 
This helps protect your eyes when you are working on your computer at night.

Another macOS function is stacks. 
You can multitask, and have multiple apps open at the same time. 
They stack on top of each other and you can zoom out to see all the programs or apps you have open at one time for easy access.
